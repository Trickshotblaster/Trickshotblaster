(aka brogrammer)

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in lots of things, but mostly programming, artificial intelligence, and 3d art, as well as game design
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about making websites with html/css and JavaScript, and also more about neural network backpropagation in pytorch. I highly recommend Andrej Karpathy's Zero to Hero series on neural nets!
