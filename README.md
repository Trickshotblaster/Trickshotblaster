(thanks @someonecantcode)
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in lots of things, but mostly programming, deep learning in pytorch, and 3d art, as well as game design
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about  performance developments in GPU-accelerated language modeling such as Grouped Query Attention and trying to apply them to my own small models. I highly recommend Andrej Karpathy's Zero to Hero series on neural nets for anyone who wants to get started in deep learning!
